# The Open Voice Interoperability Initiative #
Welcome to the GitHub repositories of the Open Voice Interoperability Initiative! The **Open Voice Interoperability Initiative** is a project of the Linux Foundation AI and Data Foundation. It aims to revolutionize the conversational AI landscape by enabling voice and conversational AI systems to function like the web. Currently, conversational assistants operate in isolated walled gardens, confining users to a single proprietary ecosystem. The initiative proposes a future where users can seamlessly interact with any assistant or language model, just as they do now when navigating web pages.

Our approach involves defining, developing, and promoting standards, starting with an open, universal application messaging protocol or programming interface (API) called the Open Floor Protocol (OFP). The Open Floor Protocol consists of three specifications, the Conversation Envelope, Dialog Events, and the Assistant Manifest. This API allows assistants to interoperate across platforms, facilitating seamless communication and content transfer.

Our GitHub repositories are where you can find our specifications, documentation, and sample code.

## Why Interoperability for Conversational Assistants? ##
Interoperability is crucial for user access, opportunity, and commercial freedom in the evolving conversational AI domain. Unlike the World Wide Web, where browsers allow users to freely access billions of web pages based on standardized protocols, conversational assistants currently operate in closed ecosystems. Interoperability among conversational assistants is inspired by the web's open ecosystem, allowing users to switch between assistants effortlessly and access diverse sources of information.

## The Open Voice Interoperability Initiative's Approach ##
Standard message formats, such as the Conversation Envelope, Dialog Events, and the Assistant Manifest, are being developed for conveying information between assistants that enables them to collaborate on addressing users' goals. These specifications can be found in the **openfloor-docs** repository.

## The Standards Development Process ##
We advocate for developing interoperability protocols through an open, transparent, and participatory process. This involves collecting and analyzing case studies, publishing requirements and specifications for review, sharing work through webinars and demonstrations, maintaining a repository of documents and code, and encouraging developer involvement.

## Future Work: The Open Voice Interoperability Roadmap ##
Open Voice Interoperability plans to address issues like the discovery and location of conversational agents and to address important security and privacy concerns. The roadmap also includes investigating how a universal API can simplify development and ensure consistency across services.

## How Can I Get Involved ##
The initiative invites participation from developers, researchers, and organizations interested in shaping the future of conversational AI. Explore our sandbox software, comment on the specifications and most importantly, try out the specifications with your conversational assistants. Some excellent developer resources are available on the independent website (https://openfloor.dev).
