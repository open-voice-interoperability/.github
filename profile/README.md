# The Open Voice Interoperability Initiative #
Welcome to the GitHub repositories of the Open Voice Interoperability Initiative! The **Open Voice Interoperability Initiative** is a project of the Linux Foundation AI and Data Foundation. It aims to revolutionize the conversational AI landscape by enabling voice and conversational AI systems to function like the web. Currently, conversational assistants operate in isolated walled gardens, confining users to a single proprietary ecosystem. The initiative proposes a future where users can seamlessly interact with any assistant or language model, just as they do now when navigating web pages.

Our approach involves defining, developing, and promoting standards, starting with an open, universal application messaging protocol or programming interface (API) called the Conversation Envelope. This API will allow assistants to interoperate across platforms, facilitating seamless communication and content transfer.

Our GitHub repositories are where you can find our specifications, documentation, and sample code.

## Why Interoperability for Conversational Assistants? ##
Interoperability is crucial for user access, opportunity, and commercial freedom in the evolving conversational AI domain. Unlike the World Wide Web, where browsers allow users to freely access billions of web pages based on standardized protocols, conversational assistants currently operate in closed ecosystems. Interoperability among conversational assistants is inspired by the web's open ecosystem, allowing users to switch between assistants effortlessly and access diverse sources of information.

## The Open Voice Interoperability Initiative's Approach ##
Standard message formats, such as the Conversation Envelope and Dialog Events, are being developed for conveying information between assistants that enables them to collaborate on addressing users' goals. These specifications can be found in the **docs** repository.

## The Standards Development Process ##
We advocate for developing interoperability protocols through an open, transparent, and participatory process. This involves collecting and analyzing case studies, publishing requirements and specifications for review, sharing work through webinars and demonstrations, maintaining a repository of documents and code, and encouraging developer involvement.

## Future Work: The Open Voice Interoperability Roadmap ##
Open Voice Interoperability plans to address issues like the discovery and location of conversational agents and to address important security and privacy concerns. The roadmap also includes investigating how a universal API can simplify development and ensure consistency across services.

## How Can I Get Involved ##
The initiative invites participation from developers, researchers, and organizations interested in shaping the future of conversational AI. Explore our sandbox software, comment on the specifications and most importantly, try out the specifications with your conversational assistants. 

# FAQ #

1. **Question:** How does Open Voice Interoperability plan to address potential privacy and security concerns related to interoperability between conversational AI systems?

**Answer:** Open Voice Interoperability plans to address privacy and security concerns by investigating encryption of messages, establishing trust between interoperable conversational assistants, and establishing policies for sharing data, including data ownership and user rights.

2. **Question:** Can you provide examples of how generative AI and trained language models might enhance conversational assistants in the future?

**Answer:** Because of their dramatic improvements in capability over previous generation NLP systems, generative AI and trained language models are expected to drive the use and value of chat and voice assistance, allowing for more natural and contextually relevant interactions between users and assistants. Examples include more accurate understanding of user intent, better contextual responses, and personalized experiences.

3. **Question:** What strategies does Open Voice Interoperability have in place to encourage widespread adoption of its interoperability standards among developers and industry stakeholders?

**Answer:** Open Voice Interoperability plans to encourage widespread adoption of its interoperability standards by sharing current and planned work through webinars and demonstrations, maintaining a repository of documents and code, and encouraging developer involvement. Additionally, we aim to collaborate with external developers to validate our specifications through implementation and testing.

4. **Question:** Can the Open Voice Network Interoperability Initiative ensure backward compatibility with existing voice assistant technologies and platforms?

**Answer:** The standards provided by the Interoperability Initiative are focused on inter-assistant communication, and are agnostic with respect to the internal operations of the assistants. If two legacy systems of different parentage need to communicate, one strategy would be for each of them to implement communication middleware that functions to translate messages to and from internal legacy formats to interoperable messages as defined in the Initiative's specifications. 

5. **Question:** What measures does the Open Voice Network Interoperability Initiative have in place to ensure the security and integrity of voice data exchanged between different assistants?

**Answer:** These details are still in the process of getting worked out. However, potential security measures could include implementing end-to-end encryption, enforcing access control mechanisms, and conducting regular security audits and assessments. Additionally, we may develop guidelines and best practices for securely handling voice data and complying with privacy regulations. 

6. **Question:** How does the Open Voice Network Interoperability Initiative plan to address interoperability challenges related to different languages, dialects, and cultural nuances?

**Answer:** Although these are important questions, the initiative doesn't directly address them. However, the overall architecture allows for conversations to be channeled through intermediate assistants that could provide services such as translation. The existence of a standard messaging protocol will make it much easier to integrate such services with assistants.
